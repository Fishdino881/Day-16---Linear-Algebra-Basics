# Day-16 Linear-Algebra-Basics

Overview

Linear Algebra is a foundational subject for Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI
On Day 16, I focused on understanding the core mathematical concepts that power algorithms behind models, optimizers, and neural networks.

This day was about building conceptual clarity, not memorization.

 Topics Covered

1️⃣ Scalars

  Single numerical values
  Used for scaling vectors and matrices

Example:
`5, -3, 2.7`

---

2️⃣ Vectors

 One-dimensional arrays of numbers
 Represent magnitude and direction

Example:
[ 1, 2, 3 ]

Use cases:

 Feature representation
 Word embeddings
 Coordinates in space

---

3️⃣ Matrices

 Two-dimensional collection of numbers (rows × columns)

Example:
[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
]

Use cases:

 Image data
 Dataset storage
 Neural network weights

---

4️⃣ Vector Operations

 Addition & subtraction
 Scalar multiplication
 Dot product (basic understanding)

---

5️⃣ Matrix Operations

 Matrix addition
 Matrix multiplication
 Transpose of a matrix

---

6️⃣ Identity & Zero Matrix

 Identity matrix behaves like 1 in multiplication
 Zero matrix contains only zeros

---

7️⃣ Why Linear Algebra Matters in AI

 Model weights are matrices
 Inputs are vectors
 Training involves matrix multiplication
 Optimization relies on linear transformations

---

Key Takeaways

 Linear Algebra is the language of Machine Learning
 Vectors and matrices represent real-world data
